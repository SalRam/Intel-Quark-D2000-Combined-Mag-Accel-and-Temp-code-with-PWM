# Intel-Quark-D2000-Combined-Mag-Accel-and-Temp-code-with-PWM
This repository contains modified code from intel ISSM template that results in output from the Intel 
Quark D2000 sensors(magnetometer, accelerometer, and temperature) in one execution. Only files that were modified are provided.
To get the rest of the files, download the templates provided in the Intel System Studio for Micrcontrollers.

The files modified from the original template are "main.c", "bmc_150.h", "bmc_150.h"




Team Name: Summer 2016 Interns.
